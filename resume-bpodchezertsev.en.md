# Main goal
To enhance team efficiency today and in the future.

# How I work
I analyze problems and code to address both immediate and future needs, creating guidelines to prevent future bugs and improve maintainability. I aim to develop solutions with unique features, organizing code predictably.

# Explanation of the main goal
I focus on productivity across teams by creating reusable helpers, libraries, APIs, and tools for development, testing, and support teams to improve efficiency and avoid repetitive tasks.

# How I work explained
I analyze large codebases for potential improvements, working closely with teams to implement solutions while avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. I prioritize long-term improvements to prevent recurring issues, with a focus on DDD and clear documentation.

# Development style
- Declarative design, DDD, functional design
- Helper functions and small libraries
- Generalized algorithms
- Extensive use of metadata and code generation
- Good documentation and visual aids
- Tools for debugging, data collection, and monitoring

# Types of projects
- frameworks
- libraries
- rich UI
- backend
- web-client
- CLI
- script engines
- embedded
- hardware (e.g., testbeds, CNC)

# Largest projects I've done by type:
- Largest fully my code: universal report generator (~1M lines Java, Delphi, VBA)
- Largest refactoring: refactoring of license plate recognition system (~500k lines FPC/Delphi, Java, C++)
- Largest metadata workflow: metadata workflow for restaurant software (~100k lines Java)
- Largest embedded: embedded software for telephony (~10k lines C++)

# My latest pet-projects in progress
- An umbrella software project for multi-language compatibility high-performance libraries (Java, Rust, others)
- A hardware project to develop omnidirectional drone family (CAD, Python, hands)
- A sci-fi novel in progress
