### How I work
- Deeply analyze the code/problem to find ways to fix not only current issues but also future improvements, and create recommendations for that.
- Make it harder to create future bugs by organizing the code in predictive ways.
- Don't stop at exploring common areas, but try to develop something with unique features.

### Development style
- Declarative design
- Domain-driven design
- Functional design
- Metadata-driven architecture

### Types of projects
- software types: frameworks, libraries, backend, rich UI, web-client, CLI, low-level, embedded
- software areas: parsers, script engines, monitoring, metrics, 2D renders, modeling, code generation
- hardware-related: drivers, hardware interfaces, modeling, manufacturing, milling machines, CNC, testbeds  

### Areas of application
- system programming, reverse engineering, R&D
- SAAS
- fintech
- healthtech
- insurance, car insurance
- geosurveying
- hardware, testbeds, R&D

### My UI-related works
- Metadata-driven UI libraries (+ two-way tools) (Java + Swing, Delphi, Lazarus)
- Functional-reactive UI libraries and helpers (Java + Swing, Delphi, Lazarus)
- Functional scripting engines an/or interactive script consoles for local and remote app models and UI controls (Java + Swing, Delphi)
- GUI facade and remote facade for text-based app models (Delphi, C++, WinAPI)
- Vector GUIs (Java, Delphi, Javascript)
- Also: Android, SWT, JWS, GWT

### My backend-related works
- Functional scripts for UI models and backend models (Java)
- GraphQL-like queries from multiple data sources, including the queries themselves (Java)
- Workers subprocesses sandboxing to avoid instability of native libraries (Java, Delphi, Pascal, C++, OpenCV)
- Functional scripting engines for UI models and backend models (Java, Delphi)
- GUI facade and remote facade for text-based UI libraries (Pascal, C++, WinAPI)
- Native libraries integrations.

### My hardware-related works
- Telephony interfaces, management consoles, configuring and monitoring software, billing services, embedded software (Delphi/Lazarus, Java, C++, C++ Builder, Watcom C++, Watcom Optima, Assembler)
- Computer Vision (OpenCV), IP Cameras (Delphi/Lazarus, Java, C++, C++ Builder)
- APIs and management consoles for fiscal printers. (Delphi)
- Spy tools for reverse-engineering protocols of medical devices interfaces. (Delphi)
- Graphics rendering software for printers and plotters. (Pascal)
- Improvements, fixes, hardware drivers, hardware testbeds, create interfaces to medical hardware equipment and made other hardware interfaces, including telephony, and protocol reverse engineering. (Pascal, Delphi, C++, Assembler)
- Design, modeling, calculations and creation of drones (C++, Python, OpenSCAD)
- Installation and maintenance of various hardware.
- Milling machines, OpenSCAD modeling.

### My latest pet-projects in progress
- An umbrella software project for all my experimental performance, compatibility, reusability, flexibility libraries, utilities and snippets. Goal is multi-language interoperability (currently Java and Rust, outdated parts in C++, Python), performance, DDD and code generation.
- A hardware project of development principal new multipurpose omnidirectional drone family (I use CADs and Python for 3D-modelling and principal modelling).
- Literature project of hard sci-fi novell in the nearest future.

### Other pet-projects
- various programming languages (Java, C#, Rust, C++, Python, Javascript): rare patterns, metadata, dynamic classes, complex type safety, data transformations/mutations, binary protocols + memory mapped files, reflection, etc.
- javascript: layered declarative modules dependence resolving library, safe code serialization library, virtual UI library, Bindows, Babylon, Node.js, etc.
- java: standard library (and basic methods) variations and optimizations, declarative proxies, dependence resolvers, SWT, GWT, Vaadin, libGDX, etc.
- hardware: aircraft designs (overall, frame, propulsion), testbeds, etc.
