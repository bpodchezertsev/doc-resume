### My goals
- As a Team Leader: Improve the team's performance today and in the future.
- As a Business Analyst: Design features as combinations of reusable, long-term parts.
- As a System Architect: Design the most safe, reusable, and efficient long-term solutions.
- As a Software Developer: Implement safe, reusable, and efficient long-term solutions with the smallest possible code and useful features per code size.

### How I work
- Deeply analyze the code/problem to find ways to fix not only current issues but also future improvements, and create recommendations for that.
- Make it harder to create future bugs by organizing the code in predictive ways.
- Don't stop at exploring common areas, but try to develop something with unique features.

### Explanation of the main goals
In many of my works, I focus on the productivity of our teams.
- For our development teams, I have created reusable helpers, libraries, and frameworks to avoid routine operations and isolate complex decisions.
- For the development and testing teams, I create APIs and tools for debugging, data collection and output, analysis, and monitoring.
- For the support teams, I create useful APIs and tools.

### Explanation of how I work
- I analyze huge amounts of code to find possible solutions and improvements from simple bugs to major design flaws.
- In my job, I actively take further direction from our and other teams and try to test and implement solutions to address these directions,
  avoiding bureaucracy to help teams work without headaches.
- In all my jobs, I get the most difficult tasks, creating many tasks for bugs and design flaws that I find.

### Development style
- Declarative design
- Domain-driven design
- Functional design
- Metadata-driven architecture

_I mainly troubleshoot multithreading issues in many projects, including backend projects._

### My hardware-related works
- Telephony interfaces, management consoles, configuring and monitoring software, billing services, embedded software (Delphi/Lazarus, Java, C++, C++ Builder, Watcom C++, Watcom Optima, Assembler)
- Computer Vision (OpenCV), IP Cameras (Delphi/Lazarus, Java, C++, C++ Builder)
- APIs and management consoles for fiscal printers. (Delphi)
- Spy tools for reverse-engineering protocols of medical devices interfaces. (Delphi)
- Graphics rendering software for printers and plotters. (Pascal)
- Improvements, fixes, hardware drivers, hardware testbeds, create interfaces to medical hardware equipment and made other hardware interfaces, including telephony, and protocol reverse engineering. (Pascal, Delphi, C++, Assembler)
- Design, modeling, calculations and creation of drones (C++, Python, OpenSCAD)
- Installation and maintenance of various hardware.
- Milling machines, OpenSCAD modeling.

_I mainly troubleshoot hardware issues in many projects, including side jobs._

### Largest projects by type
- Largest project I made: Universal report generator: ~1M lines Java, Delphi, VBA. (Also my largest multilanguage scripting engines and metadata-based operations.)
- Largest refactoring (+migrations +extensions) I made: Licence plate recognition systems: ~500K lines of FPC/Lazarus/Delphi, Java, C++.
- Largest metadata collectors & code generators I made: Iiko/Syrve restaurant software: ~100K lines of Java
- Largest embedded I made: Telephony hardware: ~10K lines of C++

### My latest pet-projects in progress
- An umbrella software project for all my experimental performance, compatibility, reusability, flexibility libraries, utilities and snippets. Goal is multi-language interoperability (currently Java and Rust, outdated parts in C++, Python), performance, DDD and code generation.
- A hardware project of development principal new multipurpose omnidirectional drone family (I use CADs and Python for 3D-modelling and principal modelling).
- Literature project of hard sci-fi novell in the nearest future.

### Other pet-projects
- various programming languages (Java, C#, Rust, C++, Python, Javascript): rare patterns, metadata, dynamic classes, complex type safety, data transformations/mutations, binary protocols + memory mapped files, reflection, etc.
- javascript: layered declarative modules dependence resolving library, safe code serialization library, virtual UI library, Bindows, Babylon, Node.js, etc.
- java: standard library (and basic methods) variations and optimizations, declarative proxies, dependence resolvers, SWT, GWT, Vaadin, libGDX, etc.
- hardware: aircraft designs (overall, frame, propulsion), testbeds, etc.
