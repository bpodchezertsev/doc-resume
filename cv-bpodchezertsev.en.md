### Migration-related works
- Migrating XBase (COBOL-related) GIS applications from to Pascal (Delphi) GUI applications. (Method: Complete rewrite)
- Migration of Pascal (Delphi) text/console banking applications from to GUI applications. (Method: Layer extraction)
- Migration of controller tools from Turbo BASIC to C++ (Method: Complete rewrite)
- Migration of Java insurance applications from Oracle to Sybase (Method: Layer extraction)
- Migration of stored procedures wrapped in web services to a direct DB access layer for a Java insurance web application (Method: Layer extraction)
- Migration of a monolithic Delphi (Lazarus) + C++ C/S video analytics system to a modular multi-platform (Linux, ARM, Android) multi-language (+Java, +Scripts) system, which allowed creating assemblies from a standalone apps to a multi-tier systems. (Method: Layer extraction + partial rewrite)
- Migration of a multi-language system to a standard API. (Method: (Semi)automated migration + data model migration + code generation (generation gap) + layer extraction)

### UI-related works
