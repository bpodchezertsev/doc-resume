# My goals
- As a Team Leader: Improve the team's performance today and in the future.
- As a Business Analyst: Design features as combinations of reusable, long-term parts.
- As a System Architect: Design the most safe, reusable, and efficient long-term solutions.
- As a Software Developer: Implement safe, reusable, and efficient long-term solutions with the smallest possible code and useful features per code size.

# How I work
- Deeply analyze the code/problem to find ways to fix not only current issues but also future improvements, and create recommendations for that.
- Make it harder to create future bugs by organizing the code in predictive ways.
- Don't stop at exploring common areas, but try to develop something with unique features.

# Explanation of the main goals
In many of my works, I focus on the productivity of our teams.
- For our development teams, I have created reusable helpers, libraries, and frameworks to avoid routine operations and isolate complex decisions.
- For the development and testing teams, I create APIs and tools for debugging, data collection and output, analysis, and monitoring.
- For the support teams, I create useful APIs and tools.

# Explanation of how I work
- I analyze huge amounts of code to find possible solutions and improvements from simple bugs to major design flaws.
- In my job, I actively take further direction from our and other teams and try to test and implement solutions to address these directions,
  avoiding bureaucracy to help teams work without headaches.
- In all my jobs, I get the most difficult tasks, creating many tasks for bugs and design flaws that I find.

# Development style
- Declarative design, domain-driven design, functional design, metadata-driven architecture
- Use generalized algorithms as much as possible
- Create many helper functions and small independent libraries to avoid routine operations
- Extensive use of metadata, collecting metadata from various sources, code generation
- Make well-documented code and tools, create guides, use diagrams for better visualization
- Create APIs and tools for debugging, data collection and derivations, analysis and monitoring
